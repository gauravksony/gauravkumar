      # Understanding Big O Notation: A Comprehensive Guide

      Big O notation is one of the most fundamental concepts in computer science, yet it can be intimidating for beginners. In this article, we'll break down what Big O notation is, why it matters, and how to use it to analyze algorithms.

      ## What is Big O Notation?

      Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. In computer science, it's used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.

      For example, if we say an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), it means the time the algorithm takes to complete grows linearly with the size of the input.

      ## Common Time Complexities

      Here are some common time complexities you'll encounter:

      - **O(1)** - Constant Time: The algorithm takes the same amount of time regardless of the input size.
      - **O(log n)** - Logarithmic Time: The algorithm's time requirement grows logarithmically as the input size increases.
      - **O(n)** - Linear Time: The time grows linearly with the input size.
      - **O(n log n)** - Linearithmic Time: Common in efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort.
      - **O(nÂ²)** - Quadratic Time: Often seen in algorithms with nested loops.
      - **O(2^n)** - Exponential Time: The time doubles with each addition to the input.

      ## Practical Examples

      Let's look at some code examples to understand these complexities better.
